# BR'OCK
### The assisted brain clock

## Synopsis
A full-stack React/Node web app that combines alarm clock functions with brain-training flash cards. Set a timer and when it goes off you are served a set of 6 flash cards that you must answer to turn off the alarm.

This capstone project was conceived, designed, and coded by Steven Kim, Stanley Chen, and Greg Foreman over a 2 week period at the completion of their Sept 2018 - Jan 2019 Cohort of the [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Full Stack Immersive Coding Bootcamp in Atlanta GA. *BR'OCK* was built with React, React Router, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Javascript/ES6, CSS3, and HTML5.

## Features
- Create a User Account and login (password hashing and authentication provided via [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser))
- Set an alarm timer for a future date/time
- Choose a canned deck of Math or Sequence flash cards, or one of your private flash card decks, for your BR'OCK alarm
- Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete your own decks of question and answer flash cards
- When your timer goes off, you get 6 attempts to correctly answer 3 flash cards
- Track your progress with saved scores from each alarm session to see how you have improved
